    <h2>Chapter no 2</h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
        an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
        of <i>Nature</i>, New Scientist,</i> and all
        the other scientific journals her work hadappeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <i> On The Road.</i>
        It had been Molly's favorite book
        since college, and the longer she spent in these
        four walls the more she felt she needed to be
        free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
        sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
        proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
            people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
        many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
        the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
        outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think
        she had something better to do.</p>
